Usually, small collections of personal knowledge are created on the web:\n\n> \"Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis\" [@appleton2020Brief].\n\nIn other words, a *garden* is a flexible collection of evolving ideas connected through contextual associations rather than organised by publication date. These notes are usually incomplete, exploratory thoughts that develop and become rigid over time, but they are less polished compared to traditional personal websites.\n\nThis more or less lengthy video presentation in @fig-digitalgarden describes this concept:\n\n::: {#fig-digitalgarden}\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8uo9oPmx84 title=\"What is Digital Gardening?\" start=\"0\" aspect-ratio=\"16x9\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video \"Digital Gardening in the Age of the Platform\" by Cailean Finn. Presented at the 2nd Symposium on Digital Art in Ireland, University College Cork, June 2024 (Source: <https://youtu.be/S8uo9oPmx84?si=3Us9i7jv8wsSNY0o>)\n:::\n\n## What Technology do I use?\n\nAfter browsing the web on my phone, I was wondering how I could clip all the links, documents, quotes etc. Instead of sending everything to a bookmark clipper or other software, I discover the open-source and multi-format academic manuscript writing tool called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/rstudio.html). This is a publishing system that allows users to create and publish a wide variety of documents, including reports, websites, blogs, presentations, and more. All text and code is written with in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) format. For this, [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is currently a suitable editor.\n\nBesides that, I use [Tana](https://tana.inc/) (previously [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)) on a regularly basis as a go-to tool to store all the links and quotes for personal knowledge management.\n\n## Discovery of the Digital Gardens\n\nThis is what I found: There are a number of educators and people from the creative industry that are interested in digital gardening. Most pages, blogs, websites work with analogies and metaphors.\n\n[Tim Rodenböcker](https://downgrade.timrodenbroeker.de/posts/digital-garden/) describes in his blogpost \"How I built myself a Digital Garden\" [@rodenbroker2023How] how he uses 'clouds-drops-plants' as artefacts of his thinking, ideation and content creation process. He refers to some of the ideas used in the 'second brain' concept by [Tiago Fortes](https://fortelabs.com/) (see @fig-tim):\n\n> \"Clouds are notes and excerpts from concrete sources. These can be books, podcast episodes, or press articles. Each cloud is a separate text file in Markdown format. I have now created such a file for all the books I have had in my hands in the last few years. I write a note there when I find a thought interesting while reading or listening to it. Drops are fragments that are too small to represent an independent text. They are tiny stores of information, paragraphs, but also lists and loose notes. Sometimes it's just a headline. Plants are text projects. I learned the idea from Tiago Forte: he advises to organize one's knowledge in idea management tools basically in text projects\" [@rodenbroker2023How].\n\n::: {#fig-tim}\n![](images/dg1.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"800\"}\n\nDigital Garden by Tim Rodenböcker (Source: <https://downgrade.timrodenbroeker.de/images/dg1.png>)\n:::\n\n> \"I have now created such a file for all the books I have had in my hands in the last few years.
